# Team One React Decal Final Project #

#### We were inspired by the google sheet check-in in previous class, and we are looking for a insteresing way to visualize the Google sheet by rendering a website. Our project provides a easy way to allow users to serve up any data from Google sheet into a real React app. ####

#### Open App.js and inspect the main component that creates your browser view. Any saved changes made to App.js will automatically be reflected in your browser. ####

#### Pacakge: ####
- tabletop: allows us to take our Google Sheet data and export it as a JSON object. 

#### API: ####
- Google Sheet API


First of all, We have to pre-set the google sheet to published (File -> Publish to web ->Towards the bottom select Start publishing). 

Then we can get the api key of the google sheet. and key will be the entire string after /spreadsheets/d/KEY/edit#gid=0.
